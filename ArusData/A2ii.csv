The strategies I would use immediately are the note taking strategies, parking lot, the golden circle, do-now, CFU, and the ""think about a time when""...part","It would have been good to have a clearly link between the andragogy principles and how the strategies reflect these principles e.g. I can understand why CFU is helpful but struggle to see the immediate link to the 4 principles - feel the new ideas today were somehow missing an anchor that I could sort of keep going back to to consolidate my understanding (or maybe the anchor ideas did not sink in in time!). To use your analogy, I did not really feel the scaffolding building up properly for me, but felt more like trying different types of ladders to get to the roof!",No,Yes
